class LossFN(object):
    """
    Interface for loss functions.

    The class serves as an abstract base class for different loss functions.
    The forward() method should be completed by the derived classes.

    This class is similar to the wrapper functions for the activations
    that you wrote in functional.py with a couple of key differences:
        1. Notice that instead of passing the autograd object to the forward
            method, we are instead saving it as a class attribute whenever
            an LossFN() object is defined. This is so that we can directly
            call the backward() operation on the loss as follows:
                >>> loss_fn = LossFN(autograd_object)
                >>> loss_val = loss_fn(y, y_hat)
                >>> loss_fn.backward()

        2. Notice that the class has an attribute called self.loss_val.
            You must save the calculated loss value in this variable.
            This is so that we do not explicitly pass the divergence to
            the autograd engine's backward method. Rather, calling backward()
            on the LossFN object will take care of that for you.
